Version 1.2.1
Snap Screen™ App requires the supervisor to create a Supervisor ID, pay the
monthly fee if applicable, and connect to a cloud storage account (compatible
with Dropbox) where the screenshots will be sent. The app user should retrieve
the "Supervisor ID" from the supervisor and enter it into the app to connect
the device. To get a Supervisor ID, visit:

Notes: Windows will possibly show an Unrecognized App warning. Mac will show an
